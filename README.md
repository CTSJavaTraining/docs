## Why we are having this session? ##

Engineering Excellence team at Walt Disney is a high-end team working in   cutting-edge technologies and creating frameworks which will be reused by other Disney IT teams. Hence the customer expectations for the resources working in this team is really high. Because of that, we faced lot of challenges in finding the right talent.
